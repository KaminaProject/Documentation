Anyone can visit an instance of kamina-community and comment anonymously, but if the user wants to be able to have a custom identity, chatting, and reacting/liking posts/threads, and be able to vote in the mod selection, one has to create an account in that -community. But in order for someone to do that, they must download and start an instance of kamina-node.  
The kamina-node will be a simple python script that will be using ipfs, inside of it will be stored the basic information about the user (username, password, etc.) and it will also store a copy of the information the user decides to save from a -community instance. The user is also able to register in multiple instances using the same node. The only information needed for the user registration is the URL of the userâ€™s kamina-node instance and other information.
