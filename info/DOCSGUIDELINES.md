# Documentation Guidelines

## Wait what is this?
These are the guidelines for maintaining and adding to the Kamina 
Documentation. Not a code style-guide but rather a literary style-guide. 


## Present Tense

Try to keep the feature definitions in the documentation in present tense. 
Even if it is a feature that hasn't been implemented yet. This is to make the
 docs 'future-proof' so we don't have to change all the "will be"'s to 
 present tense in the docs. 
 
 
## Use Bullet Lists

Try to separate points made about a feature of component in bullets. This 
helps because...

- It's easier to comprehend complex ideas when they are cut into pullet points.
- It's easier to make changes if you can look through a list of points rather
 than have to read through an essay. 
- It's pretty looking :) 

## Column Limit

Keep the line length to 120 columns in your editor. It's a pain to have to 
scrub through a paragraph that just runs off the side of the editor for a mile. 


## Spell/Grammar Checking

Before pushing changes please consider running your changes through Grammarly
 and/or Yoast to check the spelling, grammar and readability. It only takes a
  few minutes and it's free. 
  
  
## Other notes

Use common sense but don't stress over it too much. It's not nearly as 
important as code standards. It's just so it's easier to maintain the docs.
