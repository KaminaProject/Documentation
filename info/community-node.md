## Community Node
Kamina will be divided in communities, each completely independent from the rest. Just like diaspora or gnu-social, in which you have to download software in order to create a new “instance” or “pod”, one will 
have to do the same with Kamina.  
In each -community anyone can enter and leave a comment or create a new thread, you can even create a temporary identification, but if you want to be able to save the identity information and the possibility of chatting with other users, you have to create an account in that -community.  
In order for users to exist in kamina, it some centralization is needed, but keep in mind this centralization is just temporary. Think of Kamina as a virus, the pacient zero is the most important in order for the virus to spread. Once the content of -community is spread enough, the dissapearance of the “original” node won’t be a problem for the existance of the -community. In order for the -community to spread, each user must save part of the community’s information and threads/posts/images in its instance of kamina-node.  
Now, thanks to IPFS, we can have a sort of permanent content, but that content is meaningless if it is not organized in a meaningful way. That is why the software that runs the -community instance will be in charge of dumping its data structure weekly, that dump should be available to any kamina-search instance.
