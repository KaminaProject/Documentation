# Government System
Each community in Kamina is “governed” by moderators. Moderators have really limited power, they can only lock 
threads that are considered off-topic to that community. If a moderator goes crazy creating an echo chamber of its 
own in a community, the members of that community can vote to remove that moderator from its current position.  
If a moderator is removed, elections are held and only users who have contributed to the network can vote.
