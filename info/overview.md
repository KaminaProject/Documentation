Like it was said in the home page, Kamina is a decentralized social network that uses IPFS at its core. With that in mind we have decided to divide Kamina in 3 sub-projects: 
* kamina-search
* kamina-community
* kamina-node

You can refer to them by just using -search, -community and -node.  
Each sub-project's surface functionality will be explained in separate wiki pages, the technicalities will be added later.
