# Overview

Like it was said in the home page, Kamina is a decentralized social network that uses IPFS at its core (it can be disabled in each project configuration file). With that in mind we have decided to divide Kamina in 3 sub-projects:
 
* [Community Node](./community-node.md)
* [User Node](./user-node.md)
* [Search Node](./search-node.md)

Each sub-project's surface functionality will be explained in separate wiki pages, the technicalities will be added later.  
We also decided kamina would have a [government system](./government-system.md) basically to avoid any mode creating an echo chamber of its own in a community.
