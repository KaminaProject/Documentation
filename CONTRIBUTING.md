# How to contribute
Third-party changes are essential in order for kamina to improve. We simply don't have access 
to every platform in existance, so we want to keep it simple for you to contribute patches that
get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines before you can start making
pull requests.

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a github account.
* Create an issue in the corresponding project (community, user, search, etc.) if one does not already exist.
	- Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce if it is a bug.
	- Make sure to add the earliest version that contains that issue.
* Fork the repository on github.

## Making Changes
* Create a new branch from where you will base your work.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Be sure you are following pep-8 when writing the codez.

## Submitting Changes
* Push your changes to a branch in your fork of the repository.
* Before submitting a pull request:
	- Run pylint in all the files you have modified
	- Describe the changes you've made as verbose as possible
* Submit a pull request to the project's repository.
* If after 2 weeks of giving feedback there is no activity, the pull request will be closed.
